0.3 (unreleased):
* We now require version 2.5 of the DUNE core modules.
* Restrict usage of Boost::Fusion.
  In many places we now use functions from dune/common/hybridutilities.hh
  or dune/common/tupleutility.hh instead.
  Unfortunately, we couldn't completely get rid of Boost::Fusion
  and the incompatibilities with versions >1.59 still remains.
* README, INSTALL: Mention dune-uggrid instead of ug.
* Remove the make_DPGLinearForm and make_DPG_LinearForm functions,
  use make_LinearForm instead.
* Remove some noise from the API documentation.
* Remove some unused auxiliary types.

0.2.1:
* Lower Boost requirements to 1.56 and document that 1.60 and 1.61
  cause compilation errors.
* Fix compilation with GCC 6.
* Improve the INSTALL instructions:
    * Fix instructions for MacOS.
    * Fix URL for UG 3.12.1.
    * Describe how to use Boost 1.59 from a non-standard include path.

0.2:
* Split SystemAssembler into DPGSystemAssembler and
  SaddlepointSystemAssembler.
* Compute near optimal test spaces like in Roberts 2014.
  This gives a significant speedup and simplifies the interface of
  make_DPGSystemAssembler.
* Add the possibility to cache the test space coefficient matrices
  with the newly introduced GeometryBuffer class when using a uniform
  grid and constant coefficients.
* Add new test program to profile the runtime difference between
  buffered and unbuffered test space coefficient matrices.
* Add LinearForm to better describe the rhs functions.
  This allows more easily to modify the rhs than the previous tuple
  of functions.
* Implement the travel distance weighted inner product from
  Broersen, Dahmen and Stevenson, 2015.
* Add a function to do adaptive grid refinements with Dörfler marking.
  This is not used in our examples yet.
  See function DoerflerMarking in dune/dpg/errortools.hh
* Add new aposteriori error indicator
  ||u-lifting(theta)||_L_2^2 + conforming residual(lifting(theta))^2
  used by Broersen, Dahmen and Stevenson.
* New replaceTestSpaces function to easily create BilinearForm,
  InnerProduct and LinearForm for computation of a posteriori errors.
* scripts/run_convergence_test.sh now takes a list of grid resolutions
  as argument.
* CMake now complains if Boost Fusion is older than 1.59.
* Bump CMake dependency to 2.8.12 to be compatible with latest Dune
  requirements.
* Remove now unused template parameter FormulationType from BilinearForm.
* Add dummy implementation for partial() in local bases for newer
  versions of dune-localfunctions.
* Improve documentation in INSTALL and README.
* Add .editorconfig to define indentations, etc
  (see http://editorconfig.org for more information)

0.1.2:
* Completely rewritten build instructions can now be found in INSTALL.
* Describe the example programs more detailedly in README.
* plot_solution gained additional parameters c, betaX and betaY that
  are used to specify the parameters of the transport problem to solve.
* Renamed variables in plot_solution to be compatible with the paper.
* Boost Fusion is now marked as a required dependency and will not appear
  under unfound packages in cmake.
* Don't try to install the removed header pqksubsamplednodalbasis.hh.
* Fixed remaining pedantic warnings (exept for the deprecation warnings
  generated by dune-grid which are out of our control).

0.1.1:
* dune-dpg has been made compatible with Dune 2.4.1.
* A bug in the computation of the right hand side for refined test spaces
  has been fixed. This also fixed the wrong results we were getting from
  the a posteriori estimator when using refined a posteriori test spaces.
* The definition of BOOST_FUSION_INVOKE_PROCEDURE_MAX_ARITY has been
  moved to config.h.cmake.
* Added some missing #includes and removed unused ones.
* Fixed a lot of pedantic warnings like signed–unsigned comparison
  and unused variables.
* Consistently name tuples of spaces, localViews etc. with plural s
  to distinguish them from single objects.

0.1:
* initial release, compatible with Dune 2.4.0
