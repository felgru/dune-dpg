0.1.2:
* Completely rewritten build instructions can now be found in INSTALL.
* Describe the example programs more detailedly in README.
* plot_solution gained additional parameters c, betaX and betaY that
  are used to specify the parameters of the transport problem to solve.
* Renamed variables in plot_solution to be compatible with the paper.
* Boost Fusion is now marked as a required dependency and will not appear
  under unfound packages in cmake.
* Don't try to install the removed header pqksubsamplednodalbasis.hh.
* Fixed remaining pedantic warnings (exept for the deprecation warnings

0.1.1:
* dune-dpg has been made compatible with Dune 2.4.1.
* A bug in the computation of the right hand side for refined test spaces
  has been fixed. This also fixed the wrong results we were getting from

* The definition of BOOST_FUSION_INVOKE_PROCEDURE_MAX_ARITY has been
  moved to config.h.cmake.
* Added some missing #includes and removed unused ones.
* Fixed a lot of pedantic warnings like signedâ€“unsigned comparison
  and unused variables.
* Consistently name tuples of spaces, localViews etc. with plural s
  to distinguish them from single objects.
