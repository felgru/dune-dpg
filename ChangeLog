0.1.1:
* dune-dpg has been made compatible with Dune 2.4.1.
* A bug in the computation of the right hand side for refined test spaces
  has been fixed. This also fixed the wrong results we were getting from
  the a posteriori estimator when using refined a posteriori test spaces.
* The definition of BOOST_FUSION_INVOKE_PROCEDURE_MAX_ARITY has been
  moved to config.h.cmake.
* Added some missing #includes and removed unused ones.
* Fixed a lot of pedantic warnings like signed–unsigned comparison
  and unused variables.
* Consistently name tuples of spaces, localViews etc. with plural s
  to distinguish them from single objects.

0.1:
* initial release, compatible with Dune 2.4.0
