Installation of 3rd party libraries and programs
================================================

On Debian GNU/Linux
-------------------

All necessary libraries are included in Debian Stretch and most are included
in jessie-backports. They can be installed via

    apt install git cmake libboost-dev libug-dev libsuitesparse-dev

Using Homebrew on MacOS
-----------------------

cmake installation (it requires the previous installation of autoconf, automake and libtool):
    brew install autoconf
    brew install automake
    brew install libtool
    brew install cmake

The installation of pkg-config is recommended:
    brew install pkg-config

boost installation:
    brew install --c++11 boost

umfpack installation:
    brew tap /hombrew/science/
    brew install /hombrew/science/suite-sparse

### Installation of UG

Download release 3.12.1 of UG from

    http://conan.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/download/ug-3.12.1.tar.gz

and unpack it.

Remark: The latest release 3.13.0 is incompatible with Dune 2.4.1.
        (see https://gitlab.dune-project.org/core/dune-grid/issues/13)

In the UG folder, run

    autoreconf -is
    ./configure --enable-dune --without-x CXX=g++
    make
    make install

Installation and compilation of dune and dune-dpg
=================================================

We give detailed installation guidelines using GCC and the UG grid manager.
The URLs that are given below were still active on July 2016. We apologize
for possible future inconsistencies in the links and hope that the user
will nevertheless find his way.

1) Create a directory to harbor the source code of the Dune modules.
   We will call this directory $DUNEDIR.

   Remark: Make sure that there are no whitespaces in the $DUNEDIR path
           as our build-system might not be able to cope with them.
           (Make is known to handle spaces in filenames quite badly and
            other CMake backends might have similar problems.)

Installation of Dune on Debian GNU/Linux
----------------------------------------

2) If you are using Debian Stretch, the Dune 2.4.1 core libraries can be
   installed from the Debian repositories with

    apt install libdune-common-dev libdune-geometry-dev libdune-grid-dev \
                libdune-istl-dev libdune-localfunctions-dev \
                libdune-functions-dev libdune-typetree-dev

   Alternatively, you can download the sources of the Dune core modules
   into $DUNEDIR like it is explained below in the MacOS instructions.
   This is necessary if you are using an older Debian release like Jessie.

Installation of Dune on MacOS
-----------------------------

2) Download the following dune sources in $DUNEDIR:
 2.a) - Version >= 2.4.1 of the following Dune source modules:
        dune-common, dune-geometry, dune-grid, dune-istl, dune-localfunctions
      - Link: https://dune-project.org/releases/2.4.1/

 2.b) Download dune-functions and dune-typetree by cloning the 2.4 release
      branches of their GitLab repositories

        git clone -b releases/2.4-compatible \
                  https://gitlab.dune-project.org/staging/dune-functions
        git clone -b releases/2.4 \
                  https://gitlab.dune-project.org/pdelab/dune-typetree

      Remark: In the future, these modules might be associated with more
              stable releases and found in https://dune-project.org/releases/

Preparing dune-dpg
------------------

3) If the dune-dpg directory is not in $DUNEDIR move it there now.

Building and compiling dune and dune-dpg
----------------------------------------

4) Create a file dune.opts in $DUNEDIR and specify
the C and C++ compiler in it. In our case, we have used gcc and g++ so
the file reads

CMAKE_FLAGS="-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER='gcc' -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER='g++'"

Remarks:
 - In MacOS, the C compiler is set to clang by default so the previous
   configuration option cannot be omitted.
 - The use of clang and clang++ is in principle also possible here although
   this compiler has not been tested.

5) In $DUNEDIR, run

     $DUNEDIR/dune-common/bin/dunecontrol --opts=$DUNEDIR/dune.opts all

The command dunecontrol creates makefiles and compiles the sources. It
creates a directory build_cmake inside each Dune module where the
executables are built. As a consequence, the user should cd into
$DUNEDIR/dune-dpg/build_cmake to run the examples of the paper.

For more information and options on this command, run

    $DUNEDIR/dune-common/bin/dunecontrol --help

More information on the build system of Dune can be found under
https://dune-project.org/doc/installation/
https://dune-project.org/buildsystem/


Troubleshooting
---------------

On MacOS it might be possible that the following linker error appears:
```
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
"__gfortran_st_write", referenced from:
_xerbla_ in libf77blas.a(xerbla.o)
"__gfortran_st_write_done", referenced from:
_xerbla_ in libf77blas.a(xerbla.o)
"__gfortran_stop_string", referenced from:
_xerbla_ in libf77blas.a(xerbla.o)
"__gfortran_transfer_character_write", referenced from:
_xerbla_ in libf77blas.a(xerbla.o)
"__gfortran_transfer_integer_write", referenced from:
_xerbla_ in libf77blas.a(xerbla.o)
```
In that case, adding the lines
```
target_link_libraries("plot_solution" "gfortran")
target_link_libraries(${convergence_test} "gfortran")
```
to $DUNEDIR/dune-dpg/src/CMakeLists.txt should help to correctly
link the example programs.
