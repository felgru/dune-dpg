    As a special exception, you may use the dune-dpg source files as part of
    a software library or application without restriction.  Specifically, if
    other files instantiate templates or use macros or inline functions from
    one or more of the dune-dpg source files, or you compile one or more of
    the dune-dpg source files and link them with other files to produce an
    executable, this does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be
    covered by the GNU General Public License.  This exception does not however
    invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be covered by
    the GNU General Public License.

This license is intended to be similar to the GNU Lesser General Public
