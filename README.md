Description
===========

This folder contains the sources of the dune-dpg library, which allows to
solve Partial Differential Equations with Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin
finite elements. It is built upon the finite element package Dune. For
further information on the dune-dpg library, we refer to the paper
[The dune-dpg library for solving PDEs with Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin
finite elements](http://dx.doi.org/10.11588/ans.2017.1.27719)
by F. Gruber, A. Klewinghaus and O. Mula.

For build instruction see the accompanying [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file.
See [doc/experiments.md](doc/experiments.md) for explanations on how to
run the example programs bundled with dune-dpg.
If you are interested in an API documentation of dune-dpg, see the
instructions in section [Generating API documentation with Doxygen]
(INSTALL.md#generating-api-documentation-with-doxygen) in
the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file.

Required Software and Libraries
===============================

Additional to the Dune libraries, you'll need the following programs and
libraries installed on your system:

  - Programs:
    - a fully C++17-compatible compiler and standard library (e.g. GCC >= 9)
    - cmake >= 3.1
  - Libraries:
    - Boost >= 1.63
      (Boost versions as low as 1.61, which introduced Boost::Hana, might
       work but have not been tested.)
    - Eigen >= 3.2
      (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org)
    - UMFPACK (which is part of Suitesparse, www.suitesparse.com)
    - DUNE core libraries 2.7.1
      including the staging modules dune-typetree and dune-functions
      (https://dune-project.org/releases/2.7.1/)
    - A grid manager. Our examples use dune-uggrid
      (https://www.dune-project.org/modules/dune-uggrid/)
      but one could also use other managers, e.g., ALBERTA or YASPgrid.
      (https://dune-project.org/groups/grid/)
    - for the plot_solution and the ASTI programs, you will also need
      dune-subgrid (>= 2.7)
      (https://git.imp.fu-berlin.de/agnumpde/dune-subgrid)

Instructions on how to build dune-dpg can be found in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

Descriptions of our example programs and how to use them to reproduce
published results can be found in the file
[doc/experiments.md](doc/experiments.md).
