Description
===========

This folder contains the sources of the dune-dpg library, which allows to
solve Partial Differential Equations with Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin
finite elements. It is built upon the finite element package Dune. The
scientific interest of the code can be found in the paper "The dune-dpg
library for solving PDEs with Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin finite elements"
by F. Gruber, A. Klewinghaus and O. Mula.

This README document explains how to install this library and run basic
examples which are described in the paper.

Required Software and Libraries
===============================

Additional to the Dune libraries, you'll need the following programs and
libraries installed on your system:

  - Programs:
    - a C++11-compatible compiler (e.g. GCC >= 4.9)
    - cmake >= 2.8.12
  - Libraries:
    - Boost Fusion >= 1.59
    - Eigen >= 3.2
      (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org)
    - A grid manager. Our examples use UG 3.12.1
      (http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/frame/iwrwikiequipment/software/ug)
      but one could also use other managers, e.g., ALBERTA or YASPgrid.
    - UMFPACK (which is part of Suitesparse, www.suitesparse.com)
    - DUNE core libraries 3.0-git (Git master branch)
      (https://dune-project.org/groups/core/)
    - dune-typetree 3.0-dev (Git master branch)
      (https://gitlab.dune-project.org/pdelab/dune-typetree.git)
    - dune-functions 3.0-dev (Git master branch)
      (https://gitlab.dune-project.org/staging/dune-functions.git)

Instructions on how to build dune-dpg can be found in INSTALL.

Running dune-dpg
================

In the following, we assume that we are in the directory
$DUNEDIR/dune-dpg/build-cmake .

Dune-dpg comes with three example programs:

src/plot_solution.cc
src/convergence_test.cc
src/profile_testspacecoefficientmatrix.cc

After compilation (see INSTALL for instructions), the example programs
are found in $DUNEDIR/dune-dpg/build-cmake/src/ .

Description of src/plot_solution.cc
-----------------------------------

plot_solution.cc computes the solution with Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin finite elements of the pure transport problem
$$
  \beta \cdot \phi +c \phi = 1 in [0,1]x[0,1]
                      \phi = 0 on the boundary
$$
We refer to the paper for notations and also
for indications on how to solve other Partial Differential Equations.

To visualize the solution, run in $DUNEDIR/dune-dpg/build-cmake/src/

    ./plot_solution <n> <c> <betaX> <betaY>

where
  <n> has to be replaced by the desired grid resolution,
  <c> is the linear term in the transport problem
  <betaX> <betaY> are the X and Y components of the transport direction beta=(betaX,betaY).

The program will write two .vtu files to the current working directory,

  transport_solution.vtu
  transport_solution_trace.vtu

They contain the numerical solution of the interior variable $\phi$ and the trace variable $\theta$ (cf. paper).
The files allow to visualize $\phi$ and $\theta$ in ParaView. If you have the pvpython interpreter shipped with ParaView, you can also run
the scripts/plot_solution.py to regenerate the solution plot given in the paper.
(This script was run with ParaView 4.2.0. As the Python interface of ParaView
seems to be highly unstable, we cannot guarantee, that the script will run
unmodified on another version of ParaView.)

Description of src/convergence_test.cc
--------------------------------------

convergence_test.cc uses several preprocessor variables to set the
refinement level and polynomial degree of the test search space and the
search space used in the computation of the a posteriori error.
These variables get instantiated with different values by CMake to create
executables of the form

    src/convergence_test_ls$LS_ks$KS_la$LA_ka$KA

where $LS is the refinement level of the test search space,
      $KS is the polynomial degree of the test search space,
      $LA is the refinement level of the a posteriori search space,
      $KA is the polynomial degree of the a posteriori search space.

They can be run in $DUNEDIR/dune-dpg/build-cmake/src/ by e.g.

    ./convergence_test_ls0_ks3_la0_ka5 <n>

to compute the numerical example of the paper,
$$
  \beta \cdot \phi = 1 in [0,1]x[0,1]
              \phi = 0 on the boundary
$$
for beta=(cos(pi/8),sin(pi/8)). The additional feature that is given in
this example is the computation of the exact L2 error and its a posteriori
estimation.

Remarks:
    - The a posteriori error indicator includes both the error on the
      interior variable and also the trace variable.
    - It is possible to compute the a posteriori error estimator for
      other PDEs. The current program is just an example.

The paper takes this problem as the support for numerical tests and
analyses the impact of
 - the mesh size H of the trial space
 - the h-refinement level of the test search space
on the error and its a posteriori estimation.

To reproduce the results from the paper, call the script

    scripts/run_convergence_test.sh

which will make a series of calls to convergence_test.cc .
The computation takes several hours. (you can first adapt this script if you
want to change the grid resolution n=1/H, especially the test case with
locally refined test search space of level 3 gets very slow for large n).

Finally, the convergence plots can be generated with

    ../scripts/convergence_plots.py

Remark: To regenerate the plots from the paper, it is advised to compile
the test programs in release mode to significantly speed up the computations.
The release mode can be configured with

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .

Afterwards, we can compile the test programs with

    make

Description of src/profile_testspacecoefficientmatrix.cc
--------------------------------------------------------

profile_testspacecoefficientmatrix.cc uses the preprocessor variables
LEVEL_SEARCH and K_SEARCH to set the refinement level and polynomial
degree of the test search space.
These variables get instantiated with different values by CMake to create
executables of the form

    src/profile_testspacecoefficientmatrix_ls$LS_ks$KS

where $LS is the refinement level of the test search space,
      $KS is the polynomial degree of the test search space.

They can be run in $DUNEDIR/dune-dpg/build-cmake/src/ by e.g.

    ./profile_testspacecoefficientmatrix_ls0_ks3 <n>

to measure the time to compute the numerical example of the paper,
$$
  \beta \cdot \phi = 1 in [0,1]x[0,1]
              \phi = 0 on the boundary
$$
for beta=(cos(pi/8),sin(pi/8)).

To reproduce the results from the paper, call the script

    ../scripts/run_profile.sh > profile

which will make a series of calls to profile_testspacecoefficientmatrix.cc .
The computation takes several minutes.

Finally, the profile plots can be generated with

    ../scripts/profile_plots.py -o profile.pdf profile

Remark: To regenerate the plots from the paper, it is advised to compile
the test programs in release mode to significantly speed up the computations.
The release mode can be configured with

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .

Afterwards, we can compile the test programs with

    make
