known bugs:

* When calling the update() method of normalized spaces, we do not
  update the gridviews associated with the GridViewFunctions in the
  coefficients of the inner product that handles the normalization.
  That is not a problem for constant or piecwise constant coefficients
  but might lead to wrong evaluations for other GridViewFunctions.
* src/kernel_svds.cc does not work for non-wavelet kernels due to
  changes in the scattering kernel functions.

potential performance improvements:

* Using the Eigen::Map wrapper around Dune's matrix and vector classes
  might spare us some temporary copies in the wavelet code.
  We need however to check that Map works with vectors of FieldVectors.

proposed features:

* Implement a multi-grid preconditioner so that we can replace the
  UMFPACK solver with a CG solver.
  See e.g. Roberts and Chan 2017
* In the Periter code we can currently only use scattering kernels that
  are uniform in space. For more complex benchmark problems it would be
  useful if we could use different scattering kernels in different
  regions of the spatial domain.
