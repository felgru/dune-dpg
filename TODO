known bugs:

* src/dune_dpg_saddlepoint.cc currently does not compile.
  The concatenation of solution and test spaces in SaddlepointSystemAssembler
  cannot be done properly with the new shared_ptr-to-space-tuple interface.
  The concatenation would introduce copies of spaces which would in turn defy
  the purpose of using shared_ptrs, i.e. having only a single set of spaces
  that can be refined all at once after grid refinement.
* IntegralTerm now works when factor is a callable object. We do however
  not increase the quadrature order. Thus it will only give reliable
  results when factor is a picewise constant function that is aligned
  with the grid on which the FE spaces are defined.
* PQkTransportBasis cannot be used as a test space at the moment.
  There are compile-time errors that are probably caused by using
  ChooseQuadrature without specifying the transport direction Î².
* Adjust quadrature order for non-constant function (rhs term) in
  getvolumeterm_impl.hh and in linearintegralterm.hh

proposed features:

* Implement a multi-grid preconditioner so that we can replace the
  UMFPACK solver with a CG solver.
