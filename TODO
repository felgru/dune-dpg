known bugs:

* IntegralTerm now works when factor is a callable object. We do however
  not increase the quadrature order. Thus it will only give reliable
  results when factor is a picewise constant function that is aligned
  with the grid on which the FE spaces are defined.
* Adjust quadrature order for non-constant function (rhs term) in
  locallinearterm_impl.hh and in linearintegralterm.hh

proposed features:

* Implement a multi-grid preconditioner so that we can replace the
  UMFPACK solver with a CG solver.
