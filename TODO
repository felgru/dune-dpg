* Implement harmonical extension of boundary values to obtain a
  smooth lifting that can be used for all transport directions.
* Integrate the Alpert wavelets into Periter.
  Use one sub grid per interval (i.e. for higher order Alpert wavelets
  several directions will be sharing one grid to save some memory).

known bugs:

* src/dune_dpg_saddlepoint.cc currently does not compile.
  The concatenation of solution and test spaces in SaddlepointSystemAssembler
  cannot be done properly with the new shared_ptr-to-space-tuple interface.
  The concatenation would introduce copies of spaces which would in turn defy
  the purpose of using shared_ptrs, i.e. having only a single set of spaces
  that can be refined all at once after grid refinement.
* evaluateFactor() in integralterm.hh is called with the *local* position
  of a given quadrature point, this should be first transformed into
  global coordinates. (Already fixed but not tested for interior implementation,
  has to be fixed for face implementation)
* PQkTransportBasis cannot be used as a test space at the moment.
  There are compile-time errors that are probably caused by using
  ChooseQuadrature without specifying the transport direction Î².
* Adjust quadrature order for non-constant function (rhs term) in
  getvolumeterm_impl.hh and in linearintegralterm.hh
