technical debt that needs to be paid off sooner or later:

* Replace boost::fusion with dune/common/tupleutility.hh or use
  dune-typetree instead of std::tuple.
* Beginning with version 1.58 boost::fusion has better support for std::tuple,
  thus we can maybe get rid of those boost::fusion::vectors.
* Find a proper way to handle transport problems on characteristic
  quadrilateral grids.
