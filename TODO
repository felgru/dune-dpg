technical debt that needs to be paid off sooner or later:

* The EnableIf construct seems to use behaviour of the compiler that is
  not strictly adhering to the C++ standard. We should replace EnableIf
  with proper std::enable_if invocations.
* Functions in assemble_helper.hh that return boost::fusion::vectors of
  *pointers* to local views and local index sets.
  Beginning with version 1.55 boost::fusion supports move semantics.
  Then we can probably manage our code with unique_pointers which prevents
  memory leaks when forgetting to clean up afterwards.
* Beginning with version 1.58 boost::fusion has better support for std::tuple,
  thus we can maybe get rid of those boost::fusion::vectors.
* Find a proper way to handle transport problems on characteristic
  quadrilateral grids.
