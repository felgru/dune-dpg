known bugs:

* src/kernel_svds.cc does not work for non-wavelet kernels due to
  changes in the scattering kernel functions.
* IntegralTerm now works when factor is a callable object. We do however
  not increase the quadrature order. Thus it will only give reliable
  results when factor is a picewise constant function that is aligned
  with the grid on which the FE spaces are defined.
* Adjust quadrature order for non-constant function (rhs term) in
  locallinearterm_impl.hh and in linearintegralterm.hh

potential performance improvements:

* Using the Eigen::Map wrapper around Dune's matrix and vector classes
  might spare us some temporary copies in the wavelet code.
  We need however to check that Map works with vectors of FieldVectors.

proposed features:

* Implement a multi-grid preconditioner so that we can replace the
  UMFPACK solver with a CG solver.
