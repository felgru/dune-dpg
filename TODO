known bugs:

* evaluateFactor() in integralterm.hh is called with the *local* position
  of a given quadrature point, this should be first transformed into
  global coordinates. (Already fixed but not tested for interior implementation,
  has to be fixed for face implementation)
* PQkTransportBasis cannot be used as a test space at the moment.
  There are compile-time errors that are probably caused by using
  ChooseQuadrature without specifying the transport direction β.
* Adjust quadrature order for non-constant function (rhs term) in
  getvolumeterm_impl.hh and in linearintegralterm.hh

technical debt that needs to be paid off sooner or later:

* Replace boost::fusion with dune/common/hybridutilities.hh,
  dune/common/tupleutility.hh or use dune-typetree instead of std::tuple.
  If this does not work, see if Boost.Hana is a viable alternative.
  As boost::fusion introduces new regressions with every single release
  we should get rid of it ASAP.
* Get rid of the SaddlepointFormulation and DPGFormulation types that are
  only used in LinearForm. The naming is misleading as SaddlepointFormulation
  is also used with DPG formulations.
  DPGFormulation is only used with the deprecated OptimalTestBasis.
